# Image Segmentation with YOLOv8

Overview:
This project involves fine-tuning a pre-trained YOLOv8 model for image segmentation with a custom object category. The dataset was created using Roboflow, and the model was trained with various parameters and techniques to achieve optimal precision. Hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, and early stopping were utilized to prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance.

Task:
The goal was to apply image segmentation techniques and train a model to accurately segment a new object category. YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, was used, leveraging its pre-trained weights and fine-tuning it with a custom dataset.

Steps:
Dataset Creation:

50 images were annotated for segmentation, with 40 images for training and 10 images for validation.
The dataset was created using Roboflow.
Model Selection:

A pre-trained YOLOv8 model was selected for fine-tuning. The model was modified using different parameters to achieve the best results.
Training:

Various hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, confidence) were experimented with.
Data augmentation techniques were applied to improve model robustness.
Early stopping was implemented to prevent overfitting.
Results:

The model achieved good precision, but there is room for improvement.
The model could be further enhanced with a more diverse dataset and additional data augmentation techniques.
Conclusion:
The YOLOv8 model was successfully fine-tuned for image segmentation. While the model is performing well, more diverse datasets and further tuning of hyperparameters and data augmentation strategies could lead to better performance.
